Hi, My name is Demegorash, just learning to program.

I am following the videos from Bro Code https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0

Python Full Course for free üêç (2024)

All credits for him and thanks a lot for all data provided.

I am doing this files just to get the data as a practice and to share and make it accesible for all people.

Lets start to practice.

Step 1
How to comment in Python with # and ''' There is a comment here in '''
How to use the command print in order to show on screen a string.
It could be with "" and '' (I do like to use "")

Step 2
Variable =  A container for a value (string, integer, float, boolean).
A Variable behaves as if it was a value it contains

Step 3
Typecasting =  The process of converting a Variable from one data type to another for example str(), int(), float(), bool()

Step 4
input() = A function that prompts the user to enter data.  It returns the entered data as a string.

Step 5
Madlibs game.  This is an exercise by doing a game.  The objective of the game is to create a story by filling blanks random words.

Step 6
We are going to check some arithmetic and math code in Python.
Arithhmeic and math

Step 7
if = do some code only IF some condition is True, else do something else

Step 8
We are going to build a Python Calculator

Step 9
Weight converter

Step 10
Temperature conversion program

Step 11
We are going to check the logical operators.  This ones will help us to evaluate multiple conditions (or, and, not)
or = at leas one condition must be True
and = both conditions must be True
not =  inverts the condition (not false, not True)

Step 12
conditional expressions = A one line shortcut for the if else statement (known as ternary operator).
Print or assign one of two values based on a condition.
X id condition else Y

Step 13
string methods = strings are just series of characters we can add in between quotes (simple or double quotes are valid for it)

Step 14
indexing =  accessing elements of a sequence using [] (known as the indexing operator [start : end : step])

Step 15
format specifiers = {:flag} format a value based on what flags are inserted

Step 16
while loop =  execute some code WHILE some condition remains True

Step 17
Python Compound Interest Calculator

Step 18
for loops = Execute a block of code a fixed number of times.  It can be usefull in order to iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.

Step 19
Countdown Timer Program.  Lets create a counter.

Step 20
nested loops = This means a loop inside another loop (outer, inner)
    outer loop:
        inner loop:

Step 21
collecion = single "variable" used to store multiple values
List = [] Ordered and changeable.  Duplicates are OK
Set = {} unordered and immutable, but add/remove are OK.  No Duplicates
Tuple = () Ordered and unchangeable.  Dupicates are OK. Faster

Step 22
We are going to create a shopping cart program

Step 23
2D collections = This is a list made off of lists

Step 24
We are going to create a Quiz game

Step 25
dictionary = a collection of {key:value} pairs and are ordered and changeable.  It does not accept duplicates.

Step 26
Concession stand program in order to help us to understand dictionaries

Step 27
Creating random numbers

Step 28
Lets create a # guessing game in order to better understand the random module section

Step 29
Rock, paper, scissors game in order to better understand the random module

Step 30
We are creating a dice roller program in order to better understand the random module

Step 31
function = It is a block of reusable code.  We add () after the function name in order to invoke it

Step 31
default arguments = It is a value for certain parameters and it can be used with the argument is ommited in order to make the function more flexible.  1. positional, 2. default, 3. keyword, 4. arbitrary. This time we are going to check 1. positional, 2. default

Step 32
default arguments = It is a value for certain parameters and it can be used with the argument is ommited in order to make the function more flexible.  1. positional, 2. default, 3. keyword, 4. arbitrary. This time we are going to check 3. keyword

Step 33
default arguments = It is a value for certain parameters and it can be used with the argument is ommited in order to make the function more flexible.  1. positional, 2. default, 3. keyword, 4. arbitrary. This time we are going to check 4. arbitrary  *args = allows you to pass multiple non-keywords.  **kwargs = allows you to pass multiple keyword-arguments and there is invoked with the unpacking operator * or **
